      <p>Throughout my life, I was introduced to various Broadway productions. My mom took me to see <i>Wicked</i> when I was very young, along with a few smaller musicals, but at the time I was too little for the music or storytelling to truly resonate. I dabbled in different cast recordings here and there, but I always preferred when a musical had a film adaptation I could watch—like <i>Les Misérables</i>. I remember when the <i>Hamilton</i> soundtrack came out and many of my friends would sing it during recess. I gave it a listen, but I honestly didn’t get the hype and just felt confused.</p> 
      <p>That all changed around the start of COVID-19. With more time at home and <i>Hamilton</i> released on Disney+, I gave it another shot—and this time, something clicked. I ended up watching it multiple times that month. From there, I went down a rabbit hole on YouTube, discovering clips from other Broadway productions and slowly adding their soundtracks to my Spotify playlists. That’s when I began to truly appreciate the complexity of the music, the vocal talent required, and the theatrical depth that show tunes offer.</p> 
      <p>Some of my favorite musicals include <i>Hamilton</i>, <i>Dear Evan Hansen</i>, <i>Mean Girls</i>, and <i>Heathers: The Musical</i>, but there are three shows that stand out as my absolute favorites. First is <i>Beetlejuice</i>, a hilarious and high-energy adaptation of the 1988 film. Second is <i>Hadestown</i>, a beautiful and haunting retelling of the Greek tragedy of Orpheus and Eurydice. And third is <i>SIX: The Musical</i>, a modern reimagining of the six wives of King Henry VIII told through powerhouse pop performances. There's something truly awe-inspiring about the raw vocals, layered harmonies, and rich storytelling these shows deliver.</p> <p>Show tunes taught me that music can be dramatic, emotional, and narratively powerful. Every character has a story, and every note is intentional. These musicals helped shape my love of storytelling and inspired me to see music as a way to express complex emotions and ideas. I've been lucky enough to see a few productions both on tour and on Broadway—and I hope to experience many more in the future.</p>
