      <p>Welcome to My Music Journey, a personal journey of how my music taste has evolved throughout my life and helped shape me into who I am today. Music has always been a part of my identity and acted as a solace at every phase of my life.</p>
      <p>This website invites you to join me on a ride through the various phases of genres I have been listening to throughout the years. From the upbeat pop that ruled the radio to the instrumental energy of punk rock that ruled my car rides, all the way to the Broadway show tunes that made me wish I could sing, and eventually finding my way to the indie anthems that have calmed my nerves.</p>
      <p>Each genre represents more than just a change in sound; it reflects the emotions, experiences, and people that influenced that period of my life. Through this journey, I will share how each phase began, what it meant to me at the time, and why it continues to resonate with me today.</p>
