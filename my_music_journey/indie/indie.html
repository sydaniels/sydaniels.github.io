      <p>Indie and alternative music was my most recent find and it was like I had stumbled into a hidden world. Unlike the dramatic highs and theatrics of Broadway, indie music was quieter, more understated, yet packed with feeling and substance. I started listening to artists like Florence + the Machine, The 1975, Bon Iver, and Arctic Monkeys—artists whose music didn't need to shout to be heard. Their music possessed a restrained intensity, whispering truths that were somehow more personal and raw. The next thing I knew, this genre had taken over my playlists and become my go-to listening experience, overshadowing all the others.</p> 
      <p>Indie tunes later became soundtracks of my life—perfect for rainy days, midnight walks, road trips, or even daily background noise. "Dog Days Are Over" by Florence + the Machine was a musical rebirth, with catharsis and release of emotions. While "505" by Arctic Monkeys introduced me to the beautifully melancholic part of myself that I did not know existed. Getting into this genre has exposed me to so many artists that I probably would not have heard of otherwise. Some of my new favorites include The Beths, Calíro, Royel Otis, and TV Girl.</p> 
      <p>What I love most about indie and alternative music is how it seems to take all of the best aspects of each genre I've ever fallen in love with and merge them into one. It possesses the pop appeal and catchiness of pop music, the instrumental depth and edge of punk rock, and the narrative richness I adored in Broadway musicals. It's a genre that appears to be flexible, creative, and deeply personal—ever-evolving, just like my own musical experience.</p>
