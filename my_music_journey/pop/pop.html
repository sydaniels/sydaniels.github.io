      <p>Pop was my first real introduction to the world of music. Aside from Disney soundtracks and whatever happened to be playing on TV, I didn’t have much exposure to music until I started school. That all changed by the time  I reached kindergarten and began joining my older sister on the long 30-minute car rides to school, that all changed . The radio filled the silence, and 103.7 KISS-FM quickly became a daily occurrence. The station played a steady rotation of the latest contemporary hits, which was dominated by pop music at the time.</p>
      <p>The genre stuck with me all throughout grade school and well into the early years of high school. Pop was fun, energetic, and easy to love. Whether I was dancing alone in my room or singing along with friends, it brought a kind of joy and connection that felt effortless. It’s a genre that everyone can enjoy by being catchy, upbeat, and endlessly singable. It’s no wonder that pop has remained one of the most popular genres over the past few decades.</p>
      <p>From Taylor Swift’s ever-evolving storytelling to Miley Cyrus’ iconic party anthems and Adele’s heartbreak ballads, pop singers gave me songs for every mood and moment. While my music taste has expanded since then, pop creeps into my playlists through artists like Tate McRae, Sabrina Carpenter, Gracie Abrams, and Chappell Roan. The music has changed, but the feeling is still the same.</p>
