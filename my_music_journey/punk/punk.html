      <p>I first started listening to punk rock in high school, around my sophomore and junior years. Up to that point, my playlists were dominated by pop and mainstream radio hits, but punk rock offered something different. It wasn’t overly polished or heavily produced—instead, it leaned into real instruments, raw sound, and energy that felt immediate. The guitar riffs, driving bass lines, and fast-paced drumming were what first caught my attention, and they made everyday moments—especially long car rides—feel a lot more exciting.</p> 
      <p>Punk rock brought a sharper edge to my music library. Bands like Green Day, My Chemical Romance, Blink-182, Paramore, and Simple Plan had a signature sound that was impossible to miss. From distorted power chords to punchy drum fills and catchy, shoutable choruses, their music felt alive. The emphasis on live instrumentation gave punk a kind of urgency and presence that stood out from everything else I was listening to. It didn’t try to be perfect—it focused on energy, rhythm, and connection through sound.</p> 
      <p>Even today, I find myself drawn back to those tracks. Whether it’s the rapid-fire snare in “American Idiot” or the iconic guitar intro of “Misery Business,” these songs have a musical intensity that still holds up. Punk’s commitment to real, expressive instrumentation gave it a lasting spot in my rotation—it’s the genre I turn to when I want something loud, fast, and completely unfiltered.</p>
